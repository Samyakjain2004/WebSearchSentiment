The company management teams I speak to \u2014 both in the US and globally \u2014 feel this is a range they can work within.

This removes the worst-case scenarios from the table and allows us as investors to focus on what truly matters: company-specific fundamentals and earnings trajectories,\" says Matt Orton I\u2019ve been constructive on the outlook for markets, particularly US equities. The trade deals that are being signed and the narrowing of the tariff bands are all marginal positives \u2014 not just for the US economy, but for the global economy more broadly.If you think back to April 2nd, on Liberation Day, we were penciling in tariff rates of over 50% for many countries globally. So the fact that we\u2019re now settling into a 15%\u201320% range is generally manageable. The company management teams I speak to \u2014 both in the US and globally \u2014 feel this is a range they can work within. It doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be challenges, particularly for certain industries, but overall, we at least have some clarity. This removes the worst-case scenarios from the table and allows us as investors to focus on what truly matters: company-specific fundamentals and earnings trajectories.What we\u2019re seeing in the US right now \u2014 and why it\u2019s outperforming other global markets \u2014 is strong Q2 earnings. Companies are not only reporting solid top-line growth, but also strong margins, indicating that the tariffs implemented so far haven\u2019t significantly impacted their bottom lines. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a sense of optimism. I remain optimistic and continue to advise clients to use any downside as an opportunity to ensure their portfolios are well-balanced and positioned toward durable secular growth themes.Right now, oil markets are largely range-bound, barring any major geopolitical escalation. We saw a glimpse of potential volatility during the brief standoff with Iran, but since then, oil prices have settled into a range aligned with supply-demand fundamentals.I don't expect sustained prices above $75\u2013$78 per barrel unless there\u2019s significant geopolitical conflict. That\u2019s generally good news for emerging markets. As you rightly pointed out, the current range is manageable for an economy like India.The key question is how India proceeds with trade negotiations with the US. There\u2019s potential for India to leverage a trade deal to increase purchases of US oil, potentially replacing Russian supply. That\u2019s one of the scenarios still in play.I also expect rates to be held steady \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much the consensus view at this point. As you mentioned, what really matters is how hawkish Powell sounds during his commentary.I suspect he\u2019ll try hard to avoid saying anything new and steer clear of speculative questions \u2014 like whether he plans to step down or whether Trump might replace him. That\u2019s just noise. Ultimately, the Fed is governed by a committee of voting members. At most, we may see two dissenting votes in this meeting.I don\u2019t expect any rate cuts before September. The US economy is still holding up well, inflation is relatively stable, and we\u2019re not yet sure how tariffs will fully pass through. There\u2019s no compelling reason to preemptively cut rates.My base case is that we\u2019ll see one or two cuts later this year \u2014 but not until at least September, and more likely in November or December.The long-term trajectory for the dollar is still downward. The recent uptick is more technical in nature \u2014 driven by some profit-taking following the dollar\u2019s poor performance in the first half of the year.I believe the downtrend will resume, which is one reason I remain optimistic about emerging markets. They offer strong diversification, especially for portfolios that are currently overweight on US equities.I would use market weakness to buy into high-quality companies across emerging markets. India is definitely one of the most promising countries in this space. The recent FII selling appears shortsighted, likely influenced by developments in China.India\u2019s long-term outlook remains strong. I particularly like companies in the banking sector, some automakers, and firms integrating AI into their businesses. Their earnings results so far have been very strong. So I\u2019m using the current market conditions to build positions in specific names in anticipation of a return to favor for emerging markets \u2014 with India leading the charge.",

The selloff in real estate was broad-based, with all 10 index constituents ending in the red. Lodha Developers was the biggest laggard, falling 6.31%, followed by Godrej Properties (-5.44%), Brigade Enterprises (-4.41%) and DLF (-4.30%).\"If layoffs do materialise, it could significantly impact real estate sales, especially in IT-driven markets like Bengaluru,\" said Sneha Poddar, VP - Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services TCS plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 2%, or 12,000 employees. Investors worry that other IT bigwigs may follow suit.Historically, whenever the IT sector has faced slowdowns or job losses, the real estate market in these regions has seen a corresponding dip. The Bengaluru market is likely to feel the most immediate impact, with a possible ripple effect across other metro cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad, Poddar added.Vikram Kasat, head - advisory at PL Capital, noted that the Nifty Realty Index has already corrected more than 26% from its peak, making it one of the most vulnerable sectors in 2025. He advised investors to focus on blue-chip developers with strong fundamentals and use any weakness as a buying opportunity.He also cautioned that realty firms in South India could be hit harder due to their dependence on IT-driven demand.While many companies have a strong pipeline of projects and new launches, analysts said the actual conversion into sales and cash flow has fallen short. This is especially concerning for the industry because pre-sales and collections are among the most critical metrics for assessing real estate health.Some analysts remain optimistic about the sector's prospects. Pankaj Kumar, VP-Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities, expects residential developers to post strong results in Q1FY26He said valuations are attractive, with most listed developers trading at 8-11 times adjusted Enterprise Value (EV) to EBITDA, a key profitability metric used to compare companies on operating earnings relative to their valuation.The outlook could further improve following RBI's recent 50 basis point interest rate cut.",

However, on the domestic front, the macro setup looks decent\u2014monsoons have been good so far, interest rates remain low, and liquidity is improving. These factors should bode well for the second half of the year. The third and fourth quarters could see better performance,\" says Neeraj Dewan , Market Expert.Yes, so far, the earnings have been quite mixed. As you mentioned, there has been disappointment in IT and banking numbers. Even some infrastructure companies haven\u2019t reported very encouraging results. June was expected to be a weak quarter, but even with those low expectations, the numbers have underdelivered, and that\u2019s something the market is reacting to.Secondly, the delay in the tariff settlement with the US is also weighing on market sentiment. I believe this will get resolved sooner or later. Another concern is the noise around Russian oil\u2014if the US, possibly under Trump, decides to impose fresh sanctions, that could impact us. We\u2019ve been benefiting from discounted Russian oil, so any disruption there would be a concern.These are the two or three key factors dragging the market. However, on the domestic front, the macro setup looks decent\u2014monsoons have been good so far, interest rates remain low, and liquidity is improving. These factors should bode well for the second half of the year. The third and fourth quarters could see better performance.So, after the ongoing market correction, I expect some constructive movement. The market should gradually move higher, now that results are in and we have clarity on interest rates, liquidity, and management commentary on order flows and execution. For instance, L&T\u2019s results today will be important to see if execution has picked up and what kind of order inflows they\u2019re reporting.Based on all this, we can build a constructive investment pitch for the rest of the year. Banking is one area I believe still has potential. While Kotak and Axis showed some stress pockets, there were also some positives\u2014like Kotak suggesting MFI stress may have peaked. Bank credit should pick up, and once it does, the banking space should benefit. Valuations are still very attractive, especially for PSU banks Some NBFCs have also done well this quarter and could continue to perform. The infrastructure and capital goods sectors are also looking promising. As for IT, while the numbers weren\u2019t great, they weren\u2019t disastrous either. So the downside may now be limited, but it's still difficult to justify fresh buying at this point. It\u2019s better to wait and watch for now.Yes, you\u2019re right. As you said, Kotak and Axis Bank numbers weren\u2019t great. But ICICI Bank did very well, and HDFC Bank also posted a reasonably strong set. PSU banks, in particular, are trading at very attractive valuations, and their books are clean.There was concern this quarter around NIM pressure and MFI stress, and these issues were visible in the reported numbers. But going forward, I believe MFI-related stress may subside as liquidity in the system improves. If we enter the festive season with a good monsoon and favorable economic conditions, that could ease some of the current concerns.As for NIM pressure\u2014this is a common occurrence when interest rate cycles reverse\u2014but as credit demand picks up, this should also ease. So while this quarter\u2019s results were mixed, I remain positive on the banking space looking ahead.For now, it\u2019s better to stick with the leaders. I\u2019m a bit cautious on Axis Bank given its recent results and concerns around asset quality. I would prefer to watch a few more quarters before taking a call there.Kotak Bank, despite disappointing numbers, may be the better of the two. If you see a meaningful decline in Kotak Bank, it could be considered, especially given their strong track record\u2014even during the RBI embargo period, they managed well and bounced back strongly.But otherwise, I\u2019d recommend sticking with leaders like ICICI Bank, which has posted a strong set of numbers. I also continue to like PSU banks due to the comfort in their valuations. If credit demand improves, they stand to benefit meaningfully because of the levels at which they\u2019re currently trading.",

    "title": "ETMarkets NRI Talk| Equity over debt: NRIs see Indian markets as long-term wealth builders, says Harsh Gahlaut",
    "content": "Live Events\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nIn this edition of ETMarkets NRI Talk, we speak with Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder & CEO of FinEdge, to decode the evolving investment preferences of non-resident Indians.With a growing number of NRIs channeling their money into Indian mutual funds, the trend clearly reflects more than just a quest for returns\u2014it's about long-term conviction in India\u2019s economic story.From emotional ties and strategic asset allocation to the increasing ease of digital investing, Harsh shares insights into why equity continues to dominate NRI portfolios, how taxation and regulation shape their decisions, and why India remains a core destination for wealth creation, despite the operational challenges. Edited Excerpts -A) Several key emotional and strategic factors are at play here. First, there\u2019s a deep sense of familiarity and belonging, a kind of anchoring bias, that drives NRIs to invest in India. Despite living abroad, India remains home, and this emotional connection plays a significant role in financial decision-making and investment beliefs.Second, many NRIs are acutely aware of the Indian growth story. They hear about India\u2019s rising global influence and see the potential firsthand, from macroeconomic stability and digital innovation to favourable demographics and long-term GDP prospects. That\u2019s something many of them take pretty seriously, and it shows in the way they invest.Third, for a large number of NRIs, there's a long-term view, whether it's the intention to return, support family members, or simply have a solid financial foothold in India. Mutual funds become a natural choice because they offer professional management, diversification, and alignment with long-term goals, such as retirement, education, or legacy planning.A) Interestingly, tax efficiency is rarely the primary driver behind NRI investments in India. Most NRIs are driven more by long-term value, familiarity, and strategic diversification than tax efficiency alone. That said, the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) certainly adds a layer of convenience and clarity. Despite the friction, India continues to hold a firm place in NRI investment portfolios, driven more by belief than by convenience.Depending on the treaty terms, NRIs may be eligible for reduced tax rates or claim a credit for taxes paid in India against their overseas tax liabilities. For instance, interest income or capital gains earned in India might be subject to lower TDS under DTAA provisions, easing the overall tax impact.That said, taxation is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. NRIs face a range of other practical challenges, including complex documentation requirements, understanding currency risk, and managing time zone differences when dealing with professionals based in India. In places like the US and Canada, regulatory filters make things even trickier \u2014 some mutual funds are simply off the table.NRIs also rely more heavily on service support, especially when it comes to tasks like KYC, nominee updates, or redemption documentation. For many, a lack of access to a trusted investment expert who can guide them virtually and collaboratively becomes a significant barrier.Despite these hurdles, most NRIs continue to look at India as a core part of their long-term investment strategy. The connection to home, coupled with India's long-term economic potential, outweighs these operational complexities for many investors.A) Interestingly, while these regions differ in culture and regulation, the investment mindset of NRIs across geographies is more similar than different, especially when it comes to long-term wealth creation.Regardless of where they are based, NRIs today want intelligent visibility into their portfolios and the confidence that someone has their goals mapped out with clarity.Across the board, we see a firm conviction in India\u2019s growth story. Whether it\u2019s an NRI in New York, Dubai, London, or Singapore, there is a shared belief in the long-term potential of the Indian economy, and a preference for staying invested with discipline.Most NRIs are not chasing quick returns. Instead, they\u2019re looking for structured, goal-based investing, often with the support of an expert who can offer personalisation and process.This convergence in mindset likely stems from a few common factors. Many NRIs have global market exposure and, as a result, more rational expectations. Their savings potential, especially in rupee terms, tends to be higher.At the same time, busy professional lives and time constraints mean they value the presence of a trusted expert who can help them stay on track, manage their portfolios, and navigate life changes without constantly reacting to market noise.That said, we have noticed subtle preferences in how NRIs engage with investment platforms. In digitally mature markets like the US and Singapore, there is a stronger inclination toward platforms that offer complete transparency, real-time portfolio tracking, and guided engagement, not just transactional ease.That\u2019s probably why blended models, where people and tech work together, feel more natural to them.The ability to collaborate, plan virtually, and review progress through a single seamless interface is something NRIs increasingly expect as part of their investment experience.A) While there\u2019s often curiosity around sectors, we find that most NRIs aren\u2019t sector-chasers in the traditional sense. Their approach tends to be long-term and goal-based rather than tactical or theme-driven.That said, we do see growing interest in areas that reflect India\u2019s structural growth story. Their focus is less on thematic rotations and more on strategies that deliver results quietly over time.Broadly, sectors such as financial services, infrastructure, technology, and manufacturing, particularly those aligned with the 'Make in India' and capital expenditure (capex) revival narrative, are gaining investor confidence.We\u2019re also seeing some interest in areas like renewable energy and the digital economy, largely thanks to India\u2019s momentum in those spaces.Rather than making concentrated sectoral bets, most NRIs prefer diversified exposure through mutual funds or broader asset allocation strategies. They're usually more measured than domestic investors in responding to short-term market trends.Many have experienced the downside of being sold the wrong products in the past, especially insurance bundled as an investment. They are now more focused on transparency, cost efficiency, and long-term alignment with their goals.So, while promising sectors do exist, NRIs are generally not investing with a thematic focus. Their preference is for long-term, resilient strategies that benefit from India\u2019s broader economic momentum, rather than timing individual sectors.A) The biggest shift we\u2019ve seen is how digitalisation has made investing in India far more seamless and location-agnostic. NRIs today can transact, track, and review their investments from anywhere in the world, something that wasn\u2019t as easy even a few years ago.Initiatives like Aadhaar-based KYC, digital signatures, and improved online reporting tools have reduced friction and brought transparency.That said, there are still operational gaps, especially in areas such as NRI onboarding, KYC updates, bank detail changes, or residency status modifications, which often still require offline intervention. But the intent to resolve these issues is clear, and we\u2019re seeing steady progress toward end-to-end digital enablement.Another important development is the push around GIFT City, which offers NRIs and foreign investors access to certain investment options under a globally competitive tax and regulatory framework.It\u2019s still early days, but as more product innovation and regulatory clarity evolve around GIFT City, it could become a meaningful channel for NRIs seeking efficient India exposure.To sum it up, India\u2019s direction of reform is making it a lot easier and more future-ready for NRIs to invest back home, and the message to global investors, including NRIs, is clear: India is open, evolving, and becoming easier to engage with.A) For most NRIs, the India opportunity is still viewed through the lens of long-term growth, and that naturally draws them more toward equities. Their core motivation is participation in India\u2019s economic trajectory, rather than locking into fixed-income instruments for yield.We do see fixed-income allocations being made for the purpose of asset diversification or short-term stability. However, tax-free bonds, government securities, or even newer retail products, such as government bonds or T-Bills, have yet to gain widespread traction among NRIs.They tend to be more relevant in specific cases, for instance, after a property sale, when certain capital gains exemptions are available through infrastructure bonds.Outside of those instances, NRIs who seek lower-risk exposure often still lean toward traditional options, such as fixed deposits. The familiarity and simplicity appeal to many, even if not the most tax-efficient.Additionally, for many NRIs, the risk of rupee depreciation is a factor, making long-duration, rupee-denominated debt instruments less attractive unless there\u2019s a clear tax or regulatory incentive to justify the exposure.Broadly speaking, equity remains the preferred vehicle for long-term wealth creation, while fixed income continues to play a stabilising role, more complementary than core.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

While taxation and regulations pose challenges, digitalization and government initiatives are making investments easier. Equities remain the preferred asset class, reflecting a conviction in India's economic potential, with fixed income playing a complementary role for diversification."

The merger has also catapulted banks\u2019 loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nOutlook\n\nWhile Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14\u201315% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

An ET analysis showed that in the first quarter of FY25, the combined profits of these nine lenders had climbed 19% year-on-year.Growth was hindered by sluggish credit and deposit expansion. With core business momentum remaining weak, treasury gains played a significant role in supporting profitability.Analysts said the earnings of financial companies reflect stress across the board, especially at the less resourced end of the customer spectrum. \"The sum and substance is that the economy is grappling with lower growth; there are job creation and employment issues and there is stress manifesting as financials are seeing non-performing loans,\" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research, Macquarie Capital. \"The stress is more in the middle-income segment and also at the bottom of the pyramid.\"Subdued performances from Axis Bank RBL Bank and IDFC First Bank dragged down the overall earnings of private banks, which have been at the forefront of valuation gains in the sector and are traditional favourites of overseas funds. HDFC Bank made treasury gains of \u20b910,110 crore and transaction gains of \u20b99,130 crore from the sale of a stake in HDB Financial Services that debuted on stock exchanges. ICICI Bank booked treasury gains of \u20b91,241 crore, while Axis Bank booked \u20b91,420 crore of gains.\"I think the real growth numbers which will impress you, I would say it is still a couple of quarters away,\" Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank had told ET recently. Chaudhry has said the bank will grow faster than the industry this year.Kotak Mahindra Bank, which reported flat earnings growth, is also hoping to recover in the second half of the fiscal year. \"There have been some speed bumps,\" Ashok Vaswani, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank told ET.\u201cIn the microfinance business, we started seeing stress in the third quarter of last year, Q1 (June quarter) we believe is the peak and Q2 will start coming down. This quarter, the retail part of commercial vehicles is clearly showing some stress.Credit cards take a little time to turn the super tanker around.\u201d Yes Bank , which reported low single-digit deposit and loan growth, has said the September quarter would be the most challenging for the sector as credit growth remains sluggish and the full impact of the repo rate cut begins to flow through the system, weighing on margins.\u201cQ2 would be the toughest quarter for the entire banking industry, because the 50-bps rate cut would lead to repricing of the entire loan book linked to external benchmarks, though deposits will take some time to reprice,\u201d Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, Yes Bank told ET. \u201cQuarter 3 onwards I think it would stabilise, if there is no further rate cut.\u201d",

The EBITDA margin expanded 82 basis points year-on-year to 28.5% in Q2 CY2025 from 27.7% in the same quarter a year ago.This margin expansion came despite higher fixed overheads from newly commissioned capacity at four greenfield plants in India, which are yet to contribute incremental volumes.\u201d The company said this was driven by operational efficiencies and favourable currency movements in international markets.Sales volume in India fell 7.1%, while international markets showed strength with volumes rising 15.1%. South Africa led the overseas performance with a 16.1% increase, helping cushion the overall decline.Varun Beverages continued to maintain a strong financial footing, ending the quarter net debt-free with free cash of Rs 514.90 crore.: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
